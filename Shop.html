                        " >
                            <li>Customer satisfaction: any products or services that do not meet customer needs will not survive in the market in a long term.</li>
                            <li>Dual focus: compared with purely environmental products, sustainable products focus both on ecological and social significance.</li>
                            <li>Competing offers: sustainable products may still lag behind competing offers</li>
                            <li>Continuous improvement: as the state of knowledge, technologies and societal expectation continually develop,</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>A product’s life cycle sustainability is determined by its total impact on the environment throughout its entire lifespan. To find if a product meets this standard, research the brand to see if they practice these production methods:</p>

                            <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> The company’s production conserves energy and natural resources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> The company uses distribution methods that result in a low ecological and carbon footprint. The methods must be followed throughout the storage, transportation, and delivery process. </li>
                            <li><strong>Product usage:</strong> The product doesn’t use non-renewable resources (e.g., plastic), release pollutants, or otherwise harm the environment throughout its life cycle. </li>
                            <li><strong>Disposal:</strong> The product can be recycled, reused, repurposed, or composted and does not pollute the environment.</li>

                            <p  >The bristles of conventional toothbrushes are made from nylon, which is oil. The handles are made from polycarbonate, which is oil. The see-through plastic packaging is made from PET, which is oil. The concept of brushing your teeth with an instrument made entirely from a non-renewable resource (which is simultaneously polluting and heating the planet) is absurd when you think about it logically. Anyway you look at it, the petroleum-based plastic toothbrush will be on the way out.</p>

                            <p>
                              Before the plastic toothbrush was created in the 1930s, toothbrushes around the world were made from plant and animal parts. Europeans brushed using handles made from wood. Asians brushed using handles made from bamboo. Plant and animal-based bristles were used. Materials like bamboo and wood are once again being used to create toothbrushes. Particularly, bamboo is a very promising material because, unlike wood, it is a much more sustainable and renewable material.

                            <p>
                              Conventional toothbrushes use bristles made from nylon, a material derived completely from petroleum-based fossil fuel. Because of its soft and flexible nature, nylon has been the preferred material for use in toothbrushes bristles since the 1930s. New alternatives to conventional nylon or now emerging that use 100% vegetable oil as a replacement for fossil fuel. Because they replace a nonrenewable input with a renewable one, these alternatives will inevitably replace conventional nylon as we move towards a post-plastic society.

                          <p>
                            Glass has a multitude of uses and benefits for daily life.

                            It’s a reusable, recyclable, and durable material that’s also easy to clean and use as transportable food packaging. Glass food and drink containers include water bottles and bento boxes (9Trusted Source).

                            However, glass lids aren’t leak-free, making them unideal for portable containers to take to work or school or on an outing.

                          <p>Food-grade stainless steel is durable, rust-free, and heat resistant, making it a safe choice for food storage. It’s also reusable and recyclable.

                            Stainless steel bento lunch boxes are widely available, but most products use silicone to make them leak-free, either via a silicone seal with lockable steel clips or colorful, BPA-free, food-safe silicone lids.
                            
                            Glass storage jars with stainless steel, airtight lids for keeping bulk foods like flours, grains, and spices offer the best of both worlds.

                          <p>
                            Bamboo is biodegradable and possesses many desirable traits for food packaging, as it’s durable and heat resistant (12Trusted Source).

                            Bamboo-containing food packaging includes countertop glass jars with bamboo lids, portable plastic-free lunch boxes with bamboo lids, bamboo bread boxes, and bamboo serving bowls.
                                                      
                            Keep in mind that food containers made from bamboo or other plant fibers are less durable than glass or stainless steel and wear and tear more easily.

                        <p class="para m-4 me-4 fs-5 ps-3 pb-4">A drinking straw is a utensil that is intended to carry the contents of a beverage to one's mouth. Straws are commonly made from plastics but environmental concerns and new regulation have led to rise in reusable and biodegradable straws. These straws are often made of silicone, cardboard, or metal. A straw is used by placing one end in one's mouth and the other in a beverage. By employing suction, the air pressure in one's mouth drops causing atmospheric pressure to force the liquid through the straw and into the mouth. </p></div>

                          <li><h3>ARE BAMBOO STRAWS REUSABLE?</h3>
                          <p>Bamboo straws can be used time and time again and look great in any drink. Because bamboo is a natural material, they of course won’t last as long as a metal straw, but they cost a fraction of the price and can be used for many other things after they’ve finished their life as a straw; think plant stands and props for the kids school craft projects! You can reuse bamboo straws hundreds of times over, so if we do the math, they can be far more economical than nasty plastic alternatives that are designed to be used once, and then instantly disposed of.</p></li>
                          <li><h3>ARE BAMBOO STRAWS SAFE?</h3>
                          <p>Yes, indeed they are! Bamboo is completely natural and our straws grow without the need for any harmful pesticides or chemicals. The bamboo is steam cleaned and pressure washed and unlike metal straws, do not conduct the heat from hot drinks which may burn your mouth. Bamboo is also great for keeping the drink at the temperature in which it was poured at, meaning iced smoothies and milkshakes won’t give you brain freeze!
                          </p></li>
                          <li><h3>HOW BAMBOO STRAWS ARE MADE?</h3>
                          <p>Vietnamese farmers will first travel into the bamboo plantations and forests to seek out the bamboo trees which are at full maturity. It is important that the trees picked are of good quality. Once identified and discovered, the stalks are then chopped off and transported back to the farm where they will be allowed to dry naturally under the sunlight.</p></li>
                          <li><h3>HOW TO CLEAN BAMBOO STRAWS</h3>
                          <p>The last step is a natural cleaning process. The bamboo straws are taken away and cleaned vigorously and treated to a high power pressurised wash, again using no chemicals or pesticides whatsoever. The straws are then left to dry on large hessian rugs in the sunshine for up to one week after being crafted. This ensures that they turn a beautiful golden yellow and acquire that sun-kissed natural look.</p></li>

                        <p class="para m-4 ms-4 fs-5 ps-3 pb-4">Looking for more eco-friendly, plastic-free swaps for everyday items? Loofah is a natural cleansing sponge, made up of the fibrous skeleton of the loofah plant, and it can replace the traditional plastic shower puff or body polisher. Natural loofahs create gentle friction, making them perfect for helping along the process of shedding dead skin cells and increasing localised blood flow (improving circulation), effectively tackling dull-looking skin. Simply soak them in water to soften, and lather up with your favourite soap bar!</p>

                          <p>Organic loofahs are made of all-natural, chemical-free substances. The majority of synthetic or plastic loofahs are available in many hues, although natural loofahs are often white or beige. This means that they contain no harsh colours or chemicals. Therefore, organic loofahs are safer and gentler on the skin.</p></li>

                            <h3>Long Lasting     </h3>
                            <p>Organic loofahs are more environmentally friendly than synthetic ones. As they include numerous chemicals and microplastics, they are not durable. Every two to three months, a synthetic loofah must be replaced since it eventually tears. However, the natural components of organic loofahs make them more durable and long-lasting. Additionally, plastic ones wind up in landfills, generating additional pollution. Therefore, by using an organic loofah, you are not only benefiting your skin, but you are also helping the environment.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li><h3>Great Exfoliator</h3><p>
                            Organic loofahs contain natural coarse materials, making them excellent exfoliants. If you have a rough, dry patch on your skin, it effectively exfoliates the top layer of skin. They are more durable than artificial loofahs. They are multipurpose and far more efficient than synthetic alternatives.
                          </p></li>
                          <li>
                            <h3>A Healthier Option For Your Skin</h3>
                            <p>There are a large number of microorganisms on synthetic loofahs. When left wet after usage, they form a breeding ground for germs that is harmful to the skin. Because of these loofahs, you may suffer rashes, irritation, and acne. However, organic loofahs are comprised of natural fibre, which prevents bacterial growth, and thus it is healthy for your skin</p>
